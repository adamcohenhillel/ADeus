Adeus is a wearable device that captures what you say and hear in the real world and then transcribes and stores it on your own server. You can then chat with Adeus using the app, and it will have all the right context about what you want or need to talk about - **a truly personalized, personal AI.**

## Why Adeus?

In the upcoming world, Personal AI will become an integrated part of our daily lives, they will be with us all the time, and will know much about us as our closest friends - and therefore, with Adeus, we are making sure it is completely open-source, and that you can **own** your own data.

## How Adeus is built

Adeus consists of 3 parts:

1. **A mobile / web app:**
   An interface that allows the user to interact with their Personal AI and data through chat.

2. **Hardware device:** The wearable device that will record everything the user say or hear, and send it to the backend to be processed.

3. **Supabase :** The backend and database, where we will process and store data, and interact with LLMs.
